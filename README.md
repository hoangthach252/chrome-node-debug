While running tests using Selenium with chrome 70.0.3538.110 and Chromedriver2.44 , I see 2 issues below:

1. clear and type text does not work properly.
2. The second tab which open when click a link will not be reloaded.

These issues are not reproducible when replacing ChromeDriver2.42. That's why I create this image.
